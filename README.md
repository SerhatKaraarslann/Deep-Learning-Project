#### Deep-Learning-Project ####

### Project Overview

This repository contains two comprehensive implementations of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project serves as both a practical exercise to refresh deep learning concepts and a comparative study between different CNN architectures. Each implementation includes detailed step-by-step explanations, making it an excellent resource for understanding CNNs in practice.

Please note: The materials and concepts used in this project are based on the Udemy course: "Master Image Classification with CNN on CIFAR-10 dataset: A Deep Learning Project for Beginners using Python" by Dr. Raj Gaurav Mishra.

### 1. Introduction to CNNs and Datasets {#introduction}
   
What are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)?
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are specialized deep learning architectures designed for processing grid-like data, particularly images. They excel in computer vision tasks through their unique architectural components:

Convolutional Layers: Apply learnable filters to detect features like edges, textures, and patterns

Activation Functions: Introduce non-linearity (ReLU, tanh) enabling complex pattern recognition

Pooling Layers: Reduce spatial dimensions while preserving important features

Fully Connected Layers: Perform final classification based on extracted features

Understanding the CIFAR-10 Dataset

CIFAR-10 is a benchmark dataset containing:

60,000 images (50,000 training + 10,000 testing)
32×32 pixel resolution in RGB color
10 classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck
6,000 images per class

### 2. Project Implementations {#implementations}
Implementation 1: Standard CNN Architecture

File: Image Classification Using CNN with CIFAR-10 Dataset.ipynb

This implementation uses a modern CNN architecture with:

3 Convolutional layers with increasing filter sizes (32 → 64 → 64)

ReLU activation functions for better gradient flow

Max pooling layers for dimensionality reduction

Adam optimizer with sparse categorical crossentropy

Conv2D(32, 3×3, ReLU) → MaxPool(2×2) →

Conv2D(64, 3×3, ReLU) → MaxPool(2×2) →

Conv2D(64, 3×3, ReLU) → Flatten →

Dense(64, ReLU) → Dense(10)

Implementation 2: LeNet-5 Architecture

File: Image Classification Using LeNet-5 CNN Architecture.ipynb


This implementation recreates the classic LeNet-5 architecture (LeCun et al., 1998) adapted for CIFAR-10:

3 Convolutional layers with specific filter configurations (6 → 16 → 120)

Tanh activation functions (original LeNet-5 specification)

5×5 kernels throughout the network

Historical significance in CNN development

Architecture Details:


Conv2D(6, 5×5, tanh) → MaxPool(2×2) →Conv2D(16, 5×5, tanh) → MaxPool(2×2) →Conv2D(120, 5×5, tanh) → Flatten →Dense(84, tanh) → Dense(10)


Common Implementation Steps

Both implementations follow identical preprocessing and training procedures:

Data Loading: Import CIFAR-10 dataset using TensorFlow/Keras

Normalization: Scale pixel values to [0,1] range

Visualization: Display sample images with class labels

Model Compilation: Configure optimizer, loss function, and metrics

Training: 10 epochs with validation monitoring

Evaluation: Test accuracy and performance visualization

Analysis: Training/validation curves for loss and accuracy
